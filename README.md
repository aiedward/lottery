Historical weather data for Toronto including temperature, precipitation, wind speed and wind direction. 
Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Decision Tree and Neural Network ([100, 100] size) were used to predict the numbers based on weather information. So far, no significant advantage of using these classifiers over Dummy Classifier.
